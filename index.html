    <div class="aboutme">
        <p>Enjoy coding and the ways you can make and design games or websites, it is interesting to me for cyber
            security as I want to start up my own cyber firm. I like to problem solve when it comes to coding such as
            finding errors, fixing bugs and running rigirous testing to make sure everything is in working order.</p>

        <h4 class="cloneTitle">Week 1 My Clone Site</h4>
        <p>In week 1 we started to make a clone of a website, it's in the description really. We picked a website to
            mimic/clone to the best of our capabilities and I thought Sky would be easy with some technical challenges,
            I struggled a lot on CSS aligning my items but once I figured out the issue I was able to rectify the
            problem. If you wish to view my Week 1 Project of Sky please click the link/image below to direct you
            straight their. Hope you enjoy!</p>
        <p>Here is an image of my Website Clone too!</p>
